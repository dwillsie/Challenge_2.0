                <li>AuctionSync</li>
                <p>As business operator working directly with a scrum team to develop a method for indviduals to utilize tablets with a 
                    cellular connection to complete auctions at court houses all over the united states.  My intorducting this technology
                    we were able to introduce a completely touchless process and digitize and start to advance a process that is stuck in old ways.
                </p>
                <li>Auction.com Mobile (IOS/Android)</li>
            <p>As a business operator we continue to look for ways to engage with customers.  Being a key member of both the IOS and Android scrum team 
                we were able to find new ways on how to interact with buyer at live aucitons througout the United States.  Most recently we worked to
                connect buyers with auctioneers utilzing the AuctionSync technology and allow bidding for consumers on IOS and Android devices.  By
                creating this feature we have increased sales by decreasing a barrier of entry for buyers.

                <p>This was a fun project that allowed students of Davis Elementry to find out more about a ball hockey program.  Updates were
                    provided to players and the families through the website.  I started working on it with my sons who went to Davis Magnet school.
                    We started teaching hockey to kids all of ages to get them excited about a tournament the Ducks of Anahiem put on for ball hockey
                    in April.  Since Covid the league is not playing buy we are hoping to start up next October.  Page was buil with a word press template.
